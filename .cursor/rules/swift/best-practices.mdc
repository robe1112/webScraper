# Swift Best Practices

## Type System
- Use strong types and proper optionals
- Avoid force unwrapping
- Use optional binding (if let, guard let) appropriately

## Concurrency
- Use async/await for concurrency
- Use @MainActor for UI code
- Avoid data races with proper synchronization

## Property Wrappers
- @State for local view state
- @StateObject for view-owned observable objects
- @ObservedObject for external data sources
- @Binding for two-way data binding
- @Environment for app-wide settings
- @Published for observable properties

## Code Style
- Prefer let over var
- Use protocol extensions for shared code
- Use enums for state management
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

# Architecture Guidelines

## Design Patterns
- Follow MVVM architecture pattern
- Prefer value types (structs) over classes
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Use protocol-oriented programming

## View Architecture
- Keep views simple and focused
- Extract reusable components into separate views
- Use @ViewBuilder for complex view construction
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Project Structure
- Structure: Features/, Core/, UI/, Resources/
- Group related files together
- Keep files focused on single responsibilities
